## Overview

Sprite Builder simplifies the process of creating 2D sprites from 3D models, enabling seamless integration of 3D assets into 2D game environments and applications.

## Key Features

- **3D model import (.glb)**
- **Animation sequences**
- **Batch export**
- **Real time effects**


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)

### Install (Windows/ MacOS/ Linux)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application in development mode
npm start

# Build and package the application
npm run package
```

The packaged application will be available in the `release` folder



## Quick Start Guide

1. **Import a GLB Model**:
   - Drag and drop a GLB file into the application or use the "Browse Files" button
   - The model will be loaded and displayed in the viewport

2. **Adjust Camera Settings**:
   - Use the left panel to adjust camera position, angle, and zoom
   - Toggle between orthographic and perspective views
